The following files are for the following implementation:
  main.cpp : This does the building of the debruijn graph and the euler wlak
            The functions of debruijn and euler are written outside main itself
            //work on encapsulating it


  dna.txt : This contains the DNA strand
            We split this into 10 mers and then 9-mers then make a graph using these 9-mers

            This is generated by a random function and is of length 100 for now.
            It is the entire DNA strand

  read_dna.txt: Does the required preprocessing

  generate_dna.cpp : It uses a random funciton to generate a DNA strand

  OUT_DEB.txt : here the vertices of the debruijn graph are stored after performing the euler walk.

  Output_dna_segments.txt: The sequence after reassembling gets printed here.
